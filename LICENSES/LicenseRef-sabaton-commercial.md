Sabaton is also offered under a commercial license with support. Please create a github issue for more information on the commercial license.

# Some quick FAQs about our commercial license.

## What is the commercial licensing model?

The principle behind the commercial licensing is that you can start your development for free and only pay when you are shipping a product built with this software. We generally offer a perpetial license per product.  Please reach out if this doesn't work and we will 
be happy to find an alternate solution.

## Can I try using the Apache version and then later switch to the commercial version?

Yes.
